What is the weather like as we approach the equator?
----------------------------------------------
## Part I - WeatherPy
Showcases a series of scatter plots to the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Second set of reports show the run of linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
